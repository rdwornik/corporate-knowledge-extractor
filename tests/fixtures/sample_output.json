      "technical_details": "Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Redis Cache, PostgreSQL 14",
      "speaker_explanation": "Our platform runs entirely on Azure using a microservices architecture. We chose AKS for container orchestration because it provides auto-scaling and integrates well with Azure Monitor. The Redis layer handles session state and caching, which reduced our API response times by 60%. PostgreSQL 14 was selected for its JSON support and robust replication features.",
      "context_relationships": "This architecture supports the SLA guarantees discussed in frame 003. The Redis caching strategy directly impacts the performance metrics shown in frame 008.",

      "technical_details": "RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 15 minutes, Hot standby in West Europe region",
      "speaker_explanation": "We maintain a hot standby in West Europe for disaster recovery. The RTO of 4 hours means if East US goes down, we can failover within 4 hours. RPO of 15 minutes means we might lose up to 15 minutes of data in a catastrophic failure. We do continuous replication every 5 minutes, so actual data loss would likely be less. The hot standby costs about 30% extra but gives us much better recovery times than cold standby.",

      "technical_details": "RESTful JSON API, OAuth 2.0 authentication, Rate limit: 1000 requests/minute",
      "speaker_explanation": "Our API follows REST principles with clear resource naming. Every endpoint requires OAuth 2.0 bearer token. We implemented rate limiting at 1000 requests per minute per client to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. If you exceed the limit, you get a 429 status code with a Retry-After header. The API versioning is done via URL path like /v2/orders rather than headers, which makes it easier for clients to understand which version they're calling.",
