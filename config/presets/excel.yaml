# Excel/Spreadsheet Review Preset
# Optimized for: Scrolling through spreadsheets, cell selection, data review
# Behavior: Sparse sampling to avoid capturing every scroll/cell change

name: "Excel/Spreadsheet Review"
description: "Scrolling, cell selection - needs sparse sampling to avoid frame explosion"

frames:
  enabled: true

  # Sample rate (seconds between frame checks)
  # 10 = check every 10 seconds (much less frequent than PowerPoint)
  sample_rate: 10

  # Pixel change threshold (0.0-1.0)
  # 0.30 = 30% of pixels changed = significant content change
  # Higher threshold to ignore small scrolls/cell selections
  pixel_threshold: 0.30

  # Max frames per minute
  # 3 = ~every 20 seconds maximum
  max_per_minute: 3

  # Max total frames (lower than PowerPoint)
  max_total: 150

  # Deduplication settings
  deduplication:
    enabled: true
    # Higher similarity threshold (more aggressive deduplication)
    # Excel sheets often look very similar
    similarity_threshold: 0.90
    pixel_similarity: 0.92

synthesis:
  # Focus on data insights and speaker explanations
  focus: "data_analysis"

  # Emphasis on technical details (numbers, formulas, metrics)
  technical_details_weight: "high"

  # Speaker explanation still important
  speaker_explanation_weight: "high"

ocr:
  # OCR confidence threshold (Excel text can be small)
  min_confidence: 0.5

  # Max text length (Excel can have lots of numbers)
  max_chars: 800

alignment:
  # Speech alignment strategy
  strategy: "timestamp"

  # Min speech length (allow shorter for quick data callouts)
  min_speech_length: 15

# Use case examples
examples:
  - "Financial report walkthrough"
  - "Data analysis presentation"
  - "Budget review session"
  - "Dashboard metrics review"

# Expected output characteristics
expected_output:
  frames_per_hour: "10-20"
  slides_in_report: "8-15"
  frame_to_slide_ratio: "1.1-1.3"

# Special considerations
notes:
  - "Scroll activity generates many similar frames - aggressive sampling needed"
  - "Cell selection changes don't warrant new frames"
  - "Focus on distinct sheet changes or significant data sections"
