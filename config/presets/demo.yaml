# Software Demo Preset
# Optimized for: Live software demonstrations, UI walkthroughs
# Behavior: Time-based sampling with moderate change detection

name: "Software Demo"
description: "Live software demonstration with UI interactions"

frames:
  enabled: true

  # Sample rate (seconds between frame checks)
  # 15 = check every 15 seconds baseline
  sample_rate: 15

  # Pixel change threshold (0.0-1.0)
  # 0.25 = 25% change to detect significant UI state changes
  # Medium threshold - catch feature changes, ignore cursor/hover
  pixel_threshold: 0.25

  # Max frames per minute
  # 4 = one frame every 15 seconds maximum
  max_per_minute: 4

  # Max total frames
  max_total: 200

  # Deduplication settings
  deduplication:
    enabled: true
    # Medium deduplication (UI states can look similar)
    similarity_threshold: 0.88
    pixel_similarity: 0.88

synthesis:
  # Focus on workflow and feature explanations
  focus: "feature_demo"

  # High emphasis on speaker explanation (what they're doing)
  speaker_explanation_weight: "very_high"

  # Medium technical details (UI elements, workflows)
  technical_details_weight: "medium"

ocr:
  # OCR confidence (UI text can be small/overlapping)
  min_confidence: 0.5

  # Max text length (UI has less text than slides)
  max_chars: 400

alignment:
  # Speech alignment strategy
  strategy: "timestamp"

  # Min speech length (demo commentary can be brief)
  min_speech_length: 15

  # Speech range for last frame (demos can have long pauses)
  last_frame_range: 90

# Use case examples
examples:
  - "Product feature walkthrough"
  - "Software tutorial recording"
  - "UI/UX demonstration"
  - "Workflow training session"

# Expected output characteristics
expected_output:
  frames_per_hour: "15-25"
  slides_in_report: "12-20"
  frame_to_slide_ratio: "1.2-1.4"

# Special considerations
notes:
  - "Cursor movement and hover states should not trigger new frames"
  - "Focus on distinct application states and feature switches"
  - "Modal dialogs and popups are significant changes"
  - "Typing/input activity should not create excessive frames"
