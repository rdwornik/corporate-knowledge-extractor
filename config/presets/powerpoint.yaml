# PowerPoint Presentation Preset
# Optimized for: Training videos with slide-based presentations
# Behavior: Detect distinct slide transitions with clear visual changes

name: "PowerPoint Presentation"
description: "Slides with distinct transitions - current default behavior"

frames:
  enabled: true

  # Sample rate (seconds between frame checks)
  # 1 = check every second for slide changes
  sample_rate: 1

  # Pixel change threshold (0.0-1.0)
  # 0.05 = 5% of pixels changed = new slide detected
  pixel_threshold: 0.05

  # Max frames per minute (prevent explosion on animations)
  max_per_minute: 10

  # Max total frames (hard limit for very long videos)
  max_total: 300

  # Deduplication settings
  deduplication:
    enabled: true
    # OCR text similarity threshold for duplicate detection
    # 0.85 = 85% similar text = duplicate slide
    similarity_threshold: 0.85
    # Pixel similarity (for visual deduplication)
    pixel_similarity: 0.85

synthesis:
  # Focus on extracting educational insights from slides
  focus: "educational"

  # Emphasis on speaker explanations
  speaker_explanation_weight: "high"

ocr:
  # OCR confidence threshold
  min_confidence: 0.6

  # Max text length to send to LLM
  max_chars: 500

alignment:
  # Speech alignment strategy
  # "timestamp" = map speech to frames by time range
  strategy: "timestamp"

  # Min speech length to include (characters)
  min_speech_length: 20

# Use case examples
examples:
  - "Product training with 40 slides"
  - "Technical overview presentation"
  - "Sales pitch deck walkthrough"

# Expected output characteristics
expected_output:
  frames_per_hour: "30-60"
  slides_in_report: "25-50"
  frame_to_slide_ratio: "1.2-1.5"
