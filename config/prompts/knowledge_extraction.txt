You are transcribing a meeting for someone who wasn't there. Your job is to CAPTURE what the speaker SAID, not summarize it.

CRITICAL: The SPEECH field contains the speaker's actual words. Your job is to extract and organize this content, NOT to summarize or paraphrase it into generic statements.

INPUT:
- FRAME_ID: Use exactly as provided (001, 002, etc.)
- VISUAL (OCR): Text from slide
- TAGS: Topic keywords  
- SPEECH: What the speaker actually said - THIS IS THE MAIN CONTENT

OUTPUT RULES:

1. speaker_explanation MUST contain the actual content from SPEECH:
   - If speaker explained WHY something works a certain way - include it
   - If speaker gave an example or story - include it
   - If speaker compared options - include the comparison
   - If speaker gave warnings or tips - include them
   - If speaker mentioned specific numbers/dates/versions - include them

2. DO NOT write generic summaries like:
   - "The speaker discusses the architecture" ❌
   - "This slide introduces the concept" ❌
   - "Continues from previous slide" ❌

3. DO write specific content like:
   - "Most WMS vendors threw away their old solutions to build cloud-native from scratch, ending up with products that lack features and aren't proven. Blue Yonder instead evolved their existing solution to become cloud-native, preserving functionality and reliability." ✓
   - "Data as a Service joins all warehouses together, connects with other Blue Yonder solutions, and eliminates the day-31 break between live and archive data." ✓

4. If SPEECH is empty or just "I think that's true" - write "No substantive explanation provided"

5. technical_details: Extract specific numbers, versions, dates from SPEECH

6. key_terminology: Only terms the speaker DEFINED or EXPLAINED

EXAMPLE:

INPUT SPEECH: "you look at warehouse management solutions on the marketplace and they all say cloud native... what normally happened is that a vendor has had an established solution. It's grown over many years. So it's functionally rich. And what these vendors have done, they've taken that solution, thrown it away, started developing on new shiny technology. And what you end up with is something cloud native but hasn't got that breadth of features. For us, we decided we didn't want to impose that compromise. We took our existing solution, made it cloud native, evolved it."

GOOD speaker_explanation:
"Most WMS vendors face a dilemma: their established solutions are feature-rich and proven but not cloud-native. When they rebuild from scratch on modern technology, the new product lacks features and hasn't been battle-tested. Blue Yonder rejected this compromise by evolving their existing proven solution into a cloud-native architecture, preserving both the rich functionality and the reliability that comes from years of deployment."

BAD speaker_explanation:
"The speaker discusses cloud-native architecture and Blue Yonder's approach."
