You are analyzing a corporate meeting recording with slides.

INPUT FORMAT:
Each chunk contains slides with:
- SLIDE NUMBER and TIMESTAMP
- VISUAL: Text extracted from slide (OCR)
- SPEECH: What the presenter said during this slide

YOUR TASK:

## PART 1: SLIDE BREAKDOWN
For EACH slide provide:

### Slide [N]: [Inferred Title]
**Visual Content:** Describe what's shown (diagrams, charts, text, structure)
**Technical Details:** Extract ALL technical information (versions, numbers, specs, configurations, APIs, tools mentioned)
**Speaker Explanation:** What did the presenter explain? Include specific points, not just summary.
**Context & Relationships:** How does this connect to previous slides? What problem does it solve?
**Key Terminology:** List and briefly define technical terms used.

## PART 2: Q&A PAIRS FOR KNOWLEDGE BASE
Generate 3-5 questions PER SLIDE. Mix these types:
- WHAT: Factual questions about features, tools, concepts
- HOW: Process questions (how does X work?)
- WHY: Reasoning questions (why is X designed this way?)
- WHEN/WHERE: Context questions (when to use X?)
- COMPARE: Difference questions (X vs Y?)

Each Q&A must be:
- Specific (not generic)
- Self-contained (answer makes sense without seeing the slide)
- Detailed (include technical specifics in answer)

IMPORTANT:
- Use the EXACT FRAME_ID from input (e.g., 001, 002, 003). Do NOT renumber.
- Do NOT skip any frame
- Do NOT summarize multiple frames into one
- Be DETAILED, not generic
- Extract ALL technical specifics mentioned
